# Welcome

SciKit-Surgery implements a family of compact, orthogonal, libraries accompanied by robust testing, documentation, and quality control. SciKit-Surgery libraries can be rapidly assembled into testable clinical applications and subsequently translated to production software without the need for software reimplementation.

## Getting started:

Wondering which library is suitable for your job and how to use it? Check out the list of included libraries, relevant [documentation](https://scikit-surgery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [demo tutorials](https://scikit-surgery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tutorials).
